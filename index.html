        <p>Bootstrap Offcanvas - free examples, templates and tutorial. Responsive Offcanvas sidebar built with Bootstrap 5. Examples include offcanvas width customization, double offcanvas example, left and right hidden menu and more.If you need a more advanced Offcanvas and more options, see our main SideNav documentation. This component is sometimes also referred to as Side Navbar, Sidebar or Drawer navigation.Offcanvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled via JavaScript to appear from the left, right, or bottom edge of the viewport. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers that are attached to specific elements you toggle, and data attributes are used to invoke our JavaScript.Offcanvas shares some of the same JavaScript code as modals. Conceptually, they are quite similar, but they are separate plugins.Similarly, some source Sass variables for offcanvas’s styles and dimensions are inherited from the modal’s variables.When shown, offcanvas includes a default backdrop that can be clicked to hide the offcanvas.Similar to modals, only one offcanvas can be shown at a time.Heads up! Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use margin or translate on an .offcanvas element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.Bootstrap Offcanvas - free examples, templates and tutorial. Responsive Offcanvas sidebar built with Bootstrap 5.
